# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Answers to the questions regarding the project

• How long did you spend on your solution?
6-7 hours
• How do you build and run your solution?
npm run build to build, npm run start for starting the application and npm run test for testing
• What technical and functional assumptions did you make when implementing
your solution?
It wasn't a complex integration. Thought I wouldn't need to work with a global state management tool like redux or context. Came up with the decision of using react fucntional components
• Briefly explain your technical design and why do you think is the best
approach to this problem.
I've taken the approach of using CRA with Typescript and Bootstrap to quicky kick things off. I thought its
best for small scale testing application
• If you were unable to complete any user stories, outline why and how would
you have liked to implement them.
User stories are kind of complete. I missed the point in 1 sub-story of a user story I guess. What I'd like to mention is that I wasn't able to create a separate service for API calls but if I have a bit more time
at least I would've created a custom hook for API calls and write some more tests

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
